                    <p>After 7 years of friendship, various meals, drinks, parties and several sailing holidays, romance was born. And what was the great catalyst that brought about this life changing spark? Homeland.</p>

                    <p>Christina was doing her Masters full time and working part time. Simon was being Simon - generous and caring and geeky. Christina’s one evening off a week (prior to Monday morning’s early start) was Sunday night - going to a little church community that Simon was also part of, then watching Homeland at Simon’s house (helped by the Tivo box for anytime watching).</p>

                    <p>And so, hanging out on Sunday evenings transpired into a drink… A drink (once Simon realised what was happening) transpired into a serious talk. A talk turned into more talk, a kiss, consultation on house buying, a romantic weekend in Wales, skiing in Austria, a sailing holiday in Turkey, getting roped into writing a bibilography for a dissertation, playing with nieces and nephews, stargazing and… a proposal.
