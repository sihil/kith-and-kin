Hi @invite.giveMeAName,

Thanks for RSVPing for Kith & Kin.
@if(invite.rsvp.flatMap(_.coming).contains(true)) {
We're excited that you'll be able to make it to Inverness this summer and look forward to seeing you there

If you made a mistake or want to change your RSVP then you can do that - you can head back at any time by following this link: @routes.RsvpController.rsvp().absoluteURL()
@if(outstanding > 0) {
You've made accommodation and food choices that come to a total of @total.sterling(true) and we'd love for this to be paid as soon as you feel able. You can do so by following this link at any time: @routes.Payments.home().absoluteURL()
}
Keep your eyes open for more festival details in the coming months and if you have any questions in the meantime, get in touch at info@@kithandkin.wedding.
} else {
We're sorry that you won't be able to make it, but thanks for letting us know and we hope to see you soon.}

Much love,
Simon and Christina xx
