            <p>Great news - we've found your invite. To make sure this is actually you, we've sent an e-mail to
                @emailAddress with a link that will let you RSVP.</p>
            <p>This should arrive quickly (it's probably already in your inbox) - if it doesn't then try again or let us know.</p>
